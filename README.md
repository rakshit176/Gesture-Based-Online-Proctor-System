# Gesture-Based-Online-Proctor-System
Nowadays, more and more online examinations are holden in Colleges and Institution, which calls for the deployment of examination surveillance systems. Various related techniques have been proposed for this purpose, for example, video surveillance, face recognition-based identification, and etc. 
However, there is still a lack of flexible and scalable solution to detect the misbehaviour of the examinees in online examinations. Various methods have been proposed, such as face recognition, fingerprint verification etc. However, it is difficult to apply these methods to detect the misbehaviour of examinees in online examination. A normal examinee always looks at the computer screen and puts his/her hands on the desktop. While the examinee in abnormal state might look around or whisper, and even bows his/her head and checks up with prohibited documents. 
Since the misbehaviour of examinees usually shows some changes in gesture, we propose a gesture-based solution to detect the misbehaviour which system webcam is adopted to detect the examinee's gesture, and a detection engine is developed to analyse the action events. In order to reduce false alarm ratio, a three-dimensional gesture detection scheme is proposed, both the duration and frequency of the detected action events are utilized to discriminate the target misbehaviour. 
Finally, the detection engine reports the misbehaviour by matching the pre-defined misbehaviour patterns. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed solution can effectively distinguish the examineeâ€™ misbehaviour from his/her normal action.
